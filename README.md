# Instructions:

# 1) Download the files (feel free to create your own test files, using the same format as the example given)
# 2) Open your terminal of choice, and run the python file using "python WalmartMovies.py"
# 3) Enter either the filename (if you've placed them in the same directory) or the path to whatever test file you're using
# 4) Note the path of the output file and be careful, as the output file will overwrite the old one if you run the program again
#    Rename/move the output file to stop it from being overwritten
